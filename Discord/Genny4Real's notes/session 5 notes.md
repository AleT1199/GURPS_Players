**WIP 29/04**

Our objectives in Venail:
- Talk to Thaelion Duskmere, 
- Find out how to get to Aelantir,
- Resupply our ship.

We want to figure what the people actualy need before buying the supplies. 

**We STILL need to talk to Swen.** 


We also have to pay a fee to stay from the port. 

Ereles filled out the docking documents and he wrote that he and his crew were travelling to Aelantir. (later he realized the he fucked up)

Beeing a mage in Venail is cool.

If you're in Venail you need to speak Elvish (Italiano) otherwise you're screwed.

We departed from the village of Ffoggetabbouitt 3 days ago. Thaelion the Admiral told us that right after we left the village, it was destroyed and at its place there is a huge crater (25th of April). 

Zoryan battled some archmages (maybe from Lorent or Magisterium). The fight was so fierce that an entire village was destroyed in the process. Unfortunately, the archmages eventually overpowered him, knocking him unconscious and taking him prisoner. The Magisterium blamed the destruction of the village to Zoryan.
This incident happened in Necklife, the destruction of the village is seen by the Emperor of Anbennar as an aggresion by Lorent, this will probably cause an international crisis between them, a war is probably coming. Lorent seems too powerful.

Elmisteer was an elf that was part of the Magisterium but left to learn more about the nature of magic; he was very respected in the academic world, he was also a renowned teacher. Zoryan was one of his prodigees.

Zoryan is an high ranking member of the organization, while Thaelion Duskmere is a low ranking one we're on the lowest rank. 

Erelas and Andrew feels like shit because they feel responsible for what happend with the Necklife incident . 

Lorent is also colonizing Aelantir, they will probably bring war to the colonies too.  

Venail's mission is to migrate every elf on the island to Aelantir, fortunately this process of moving the population of Venail to Aelantir will take a long time. In the meantime, Thaelion can rescue those being hunted by Lorent and the Magisterium. If we agree to host the people Thaelion sends us with his ships, he will also assist us in establishing the new colony.

We can go to the Shipyard, there are woodworking magician that can reinfource the hull of our ship.
We have a pass for the library and we can take some books, Paolo the Book keeper is there. He's not part of the organization.
