# **SESSION 4 NOTES**

## Goodbye Old World!
We start the session on our new ship, we spent all night loading all the things that the villagers owns and the things we got from the harbor people. Arthus is commanding the ship, even though he’s not a sailor or navigator. 

Bad news: the Magisterium has discovered the group — they’ll arrive in a few hours and we have to move NOW.  

Befor departing, Zorian gave us a crystal, the same one we encountered in the Magisterium, that is connected to Aelantir, probably via the Great Sentient Tree of southern Aelantir (true?). Apparently, this crystal transmits magical waves for long-distance communication. Erelas suspects the crystal might be tied to the goddess [Munas Moonsinger](https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Munas_Moonsinger_(deity)). Andrew is investigating the crystal to understand how it works.

While talking to Zorian we discover more of his backstory.
### Zorian's Backstory

-   Zorian is a half-elf from Weastern Dameria.
    
-   He belonged to a fallen noble family and fled due to the Liliac Wars. At this point him and his family were probably captured by the emperor Kylian VII and tortured. 
    
-   He still harbors deep resentment towards the Magisterium and left with a look of fury in his eyes.
    
## Journey to Venail
We said goodbye to Zorian, maybe for the last time.  Just before departing, Andrew realized that some people discovered them, but he couldn't identify who. Then the ship sets sail for Venail.    

The group sleeps for 24 hours (almost) straight after departure. When we wake up, we realize that we spelt on a hammock inside a stinky cargo hold and that we travelled a lot during our sleep.    

Aboard the ship there are: Small Jonas, sometimes he annoys everyone with his BS, but he probably has some good advice hidden between his words; a human called Swen, he calls himselft the protector of the ship. He's very good with the sword, but no one talked to him and he never approached us. There was also Arthus, piloting the ship, and there are a lot of kids, at least fifteen. One of them, Mathias, is fond of Andrew and Big Rock (his nickname for GuG).
 
### **We are a Modern Family**

Everyone had his own way of spending time on the ship:
-  Eralas, behaving like a protective "karen" mom, looked after the kids on the ship, he was always on alert to make sure no ones even gets the idea of doing something unsafe. He was also very worried that people on the ship would be in need of his assistance, so he started patrolling the ship to check on the crew.    
- Lowrence, he has brute "dad" energy, so he mostly trained his water mimicry magic all alone. One time, he teached kids "bully" stuff like how make someone else beat up your enemies or how to stand up verbally to other people. 
- Andrew, was the more curious and childlike, he also talked with the kids and he enjoyed entertaing them, he then experimented with the Aelantir crystal, that Zorian gave to us, to understand the magic waves. He finds out that the crystal pointed to a somewhere in the direction of Aelantir, percieving the magic waves that came out of the object, but he doesn't know exactly where.

### **Navigation & Location**

The group realized that they are currently on the southern coast of Sorncost, south of Lorent. There was a discussion with the group, Small Jonas and Arthus on how to reach the island of Venail. At the end we decided to sail northward, using the wind currents to reach the home of the exodus elves.

### **Encounter with the Vertesk Slaver ship**

-   A merchant ship flying a Vertesk flag was heading towards us. Eralas was very afraid of what they were hiding and tried using a new spell to spy what was happening on the vessel. He saw that the crew was made up entirely of humans and they were carrying slaves (mostly halfling/gnome). He decided to risk hurting himself to divert the ship towards the coast of Lorent, where they could be sanctioned or arrested for slavery. When the spell ended he was almost out of stamina and his firends scolded him for this decision. 
Unfortunately, Erelas will find out that he made a mistake and the ship was heading towards the open water in the south, possibly endangering the people on the ship.
