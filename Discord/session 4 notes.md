# **SESSION 4 NOTES**

## Goodbye Old World!
We start the session on our new ship, we spent all night loading all the things that the villagers owns and the things we got from the harbor people. Arthus is commanding the ship, even though heâ€™s not a sailor or navigator. 

Bad news: the Magisterium has discovered the group â€” theyâ€™ll arrive in a few hours and we have to move NOW.  

Befor departing, Zorian gave us a crystal, the same one we encountered in the Magisterium, that is connected to Aelantir, probably via the Great Sentient Tree of southern Aelantir (true?). Apparently, this crystal transmits magical waves for long-distance communication. Erelas suspects the crystal might be tied to the goddess [Munas Moonsinger](https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Munas_Moonsinger_(deity)). Andrew is investigating the crystal to understand how it works.

While talking to Zorian we discover more of his backstory.
### Zorian's Backstory

-   Zorian is a half-elf from Weastern Dameria.
    
-   He belonged to a fallen noble family and fled due to the Liliac Wars. At this point him and his family were probably captured by the emperor Kylian VII and tortured. 
    
-   He still harbors deep resentment towards the Magisterium and left with a look of fury in his eyes.
    
## Journey to Venail
We said goodbye to Zorian, maybe for the last time.  Just before departing, Andrew realized that some people discovered them, but he couldn't identify who. Then the ship sets sail for Venail.    

The group sleeps for 24 hours (almost) straight after departure. When we wake up, we realize that we spelt on a hammock inside a stinky cargo hold and that we travelled a lot during our sleep.    

Aboard the ship there are:
  -   Small Jonas is with the group, sometimes he annoys everyone with his BS, but he probably has a lot of experience;
        
    -  There is a guy called Swen on the ship, he calls himselft the protector of the ship. We think he's the guy that was very good with the sword, but no one talked to him and he never approached us. 
        
    -  There are a lot of kids, at fifteen. One of them, Mathias, is fond of Andrew and Big Rock (aka GuG).
 
### **We are a Modern Family**

-   Eralas  behaves like a protective "Karen" mom â€” looks after the kids and he's always on alert to make sure no ones even gets the idea of doing something unsafe (a contradiction because he then made a very unsafe move later);
    
-   **Lowrence**:he's the  brute "dad" energy â€” he trains his water mimicry magic all alone and he teaches kids all the "wrong" stuff that, like how if you want someone beaten up you should pay someone to do it for you. 
    
-   **Andrew**: is more curious and childlike â€”he also talks with the kids and he loves to entertain them, he then experiments with the Aelantir crystal to understand the magical wave. He finds out that the crystal points to the direction of Aelantir, but we don't know exactly where

    i maghi del magisterium ci hanno scoperto, tra poche ore ci saranno addosso.
    arthus guida la nave, anche se non Ã¨ un marinaio o un navigatore.
    zorian ci ha dato un cristallo, uno di quelli che Ã¨ collegato a Aelantir tramite al grande albero senziente delle leggende del sud di aelantir. ci ha detto che tramite questo cristallo si puÃ² comunicare tramite delle sottospecie di "onde magiche". 
    Eralas pensa che sia qualcosa collegato alla divinitÃ  [Munas](https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Munas_Moonsinger_(deity))
    Andrew ha deciso di investigare su questo strano cristallo.
    prima di salutarci per un bel po', scopriamo che zorian Ã¨ un mezzelfo che proviene dalla dameria orientale, che apparteneva a una famiglia nobile decaduta, Ã¨ stato costretto a fuggire a causa delle Guerre Liliac. Ha ancora molti risentimenti verso il magisterium, infatti se n'Ã¨ andato con occhi insanguinati. Durante la nostra partenza abbiamo scoperto che un po' di persone ci hanno scoperto, ma non li abbiamo identificati.
    La nave parte verso Venail. Ci svegliamo dopo 24 ore di dormita. 
    Small Jonas Ã¨ sulla nave con noi. 
    Swen Ã¨ il protettore della nave?
    Mathias, uno dei bambini, gli piace Big Rock (cioÃ¨ GuG)!
    
    eralas is the perfect karen protective mother, lorence is a very brute father, while andrew is still a little kid. Eralas take care of the kids, while Andrew makes some experiments with the strange aelantir rock, he's trying to figure out the magic wave. Lowrence trains with water mimicry.
    We all figure out that we're on the South of sorncost. we all decide to go North tu use the current to get to Venail
